# Question
“What’s the difference between how your website is rendered in Lab 4 vs. Lab 6?”
# Answer
In Lab 4, my website is static. But in Lab 6, my website is dynamic because the data necessary to render the website is fetched from a server via SSR. This allows the content to be dynamically processed or generated by the server.

I know it's rendered via SSR because the website can't be rendered without a response from the server. But in my case, the server happens to be the local machine which is why the website renders even after cutting off WiFi.
